# Google_Job_Scraper

this is a simple and a customizable **Bot** that can scrape for job `information` depending on what keyword(s) you give it and outputs it in an xlsx file `default : output.xlsx`

 ## How it works

***`*information`*** :

 - Date & time of search
 - Date & Time of job publishing
 - Keyword used
 - Publisher
 - Title
 - Address
 - Via which site

> keyword(s) must be put inside a text file.


## To Run it

just install the dependencies and run the jobber:
 - pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 - python3 jobber.py
